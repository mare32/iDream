							<h2>Dream no.1</h2>
							<p>I was in my middle school schoolyard on the football field playing football with my friends and then i Suddenly teleported to a foreign marketplace and saw a man that stealed a chess piece from a Trader and this guys chased him for so long and i followed him and watched the whole time and we were up in some really wierd places that i can't even describe. After that i did something that i don't remember and i was led to an open field of grass and i was alone there, it was so peaceful and suddenly 5 yellow diamonds appeared on the sky and i felt huge pressure and fell on the ground in slow motion and thought i was dying and woke up soon afterwards.</p>

							<h2>Dream no.2</h2>
							<p>I was in a coffee shop with my sister and granpa. Two american waitresses aproached me and i had to communicate in english with them, i asked them if i can order banana split, and for some reason they said there is alchohol in that and that is also expensive, so in the end they gave me plazma with water, i explained that it's way better with milk. I was going inside a Zoo and watched some wierd animals, and a funny rodent followed us, i also saw carrots leaving the ground and going back inside it.</p>

							<h2>Dream no.3</h2>
							<p>This one is lucid. I was coming off the bus in some place and my girlfriend was with me, i told her that i wanted to go back in the bus and continue my dream and she started pulling me like she wanted to wake me up, but i refused and i told her that i'm dreaming, only after that i actualy realised that i was dreaming and that was the moment i became lucid, and i did my reality check(took a look at my palm) and i saw all 5 fingers but i was sure that i was dreaming and continued on. I wanted to lick some random tree because i heard its good for stabilising the dream, and a tree apeared in front of me. I licked it, but it tasted awful and my throat started to hurt, bad feeling. I grabbed my gf's hand and continued walking on a sidewalk and i saw some dogs barfing and i woke up realising that my dog woke me up, i was so upset.</p>
